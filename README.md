Raspberry pi looping media player with 4 buttons to control the next video. Designed for old people.

This script run at boot will start playing random video's from a folder on the pi.
It is designed for my grandmother who has altzimers.
The buttons on the top give a choice of two specific video's, a folder of favourits and all video's.
If any of the buttons are pressed, the current video is canceled and a new video is selected based on the button pressed.
If one of the specified video buttons is pressed, the playlist returnes to random play when the video is finished. 
If the favourites button is selected it will lock the playlist to the favourites list.
If random is selected a new random video is selected and the playlist will be set to random.
More button options can be created with ease and the program can be adapted to create a photo album.
